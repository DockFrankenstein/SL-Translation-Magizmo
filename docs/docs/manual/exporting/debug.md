# Debug

The debug export option outputs an SCPSL translation with every line of every file being represented by it's name and line number. This is often used in SLTM's development to find which mapping corresponds to which element in the game.

## Exporting

By going over to `File/Export/Debug`, you can select the destination of a debug translation.
