# qASIC

qASIC was an asset I worked on before the great TOS change of 2023. It was supposed to make development faster by introducing multiple utility tools (such as a cheat console, input system, others).

SLTM uses an unreleased version of qASIC that I was working on before the cancellation. It's mainly used for shortcuts, settings, UnityEditor windows and various small utility methods.

## Future

I'm currently working on a newer cross-engine compatible version. Once the basics are completed (mainly input and settings systems), I'm gonna most likely replace the current version.

## Documentation

The documentation can be found [here](https://docs.qasictools.com/). Again: **this is an unreleased version of the tool. There are many things that changed, so the documentation may not be accurate (or good).**
